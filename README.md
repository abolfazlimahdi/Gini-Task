# Gini-Task

Hi, I hope you are doing great.
I received the clientId and secret and it worked well when I tested. Howeve, when I was done doing the task I could not test the application(I don't know it it is because of Iran's Internet or the secret and id was expired). I read the documents carefully and hope that I have done the response section (Invoice object) correctly.

If the app could not save the invoices, I can fix it in less than 15 minutes. I just need the response from the SDK!

Because of the time limit, I could not write any tests for the task. 

I really enjoyed reading your codebase. The best codebase (by far - even compared to Google's open source repositories on Android like iosched and ....) I have ever seen. Congrats.
